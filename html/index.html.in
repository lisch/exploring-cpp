<P>This web site supports the book <CITE>Exploring C++</CITE>
(<A HREF="http://www.apress.com/">Apress</A>, 2008) by Ray Lischner.
In time, I will populate the site with a variety of helpful
information, especially for novice C++ programmers. Right now, the
site hosts draft manuscripts of the book.</P>
<P>Please take the time to read and review the draft manuscript. Do
not rely on it for learning C++ yet. I try not to introduce too many
errors, but I have not yet reviewed the manuscript for technical
accuracy. If you have any comments, please send them to
<a href="mailto:exploring@cpphelp.com">exploring@cpphelp.com</a>.
Thank you.</P>
